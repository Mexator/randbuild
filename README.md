# Usage
While in survival mode hover an inventory slot with mouse and
press Alt. This will toggle the slot, and it will be used as a
source for random blocks. To use the slot, it should contain item
stack.

Take a block in your hand and place it. You will see that after
you placed the block, item in your hand was replaced with contents 
of previously selected slot.
